    title: ❓ Forum features
    description: > 
      You can: ask, answer and report questions, interact with other 
      users and stuff. Pretty much you'd do in a normal forum, but with a lot of 
      cool and additional features :)
  - two:
    title: 🆙 XP and level
    description: > 
      Users gain or lose reputation based on the quality of their 
      interactions with the system and other community members. Reputation is a 
      rough measurement in experience (XP) of how much the community trusts you; 
      it is earned by convincing your peers that you know what you’re talking about. 
      Every user starts in level 1 (0 XP), and you can reach the next level by gaining 
      enough XP. <br /> <br />
      When you're logged in, is also possible to see all your reputation stats 
      (overall stats and earned XP per day in the last 7 days)!
  - three:
    title: 🏷️ Tags
    description: > 
      You can see all tags in the website, as well as see the questions each one has. 
      It is also possible to follow one or multiple tags, then your feed will only 
      display questions related to the tags you follow.
  - four:
    title: 💬 Notifications
    description: >
      When your question has a new answer, or one of your answers was chosen by a user, 
      you get a notification.
  - five:  
    title: 👤 User profile
    description: > 
      Every user has a profile in the website that shows their activity, stats, 
      level and all of that jazz.
  - six:
    title: 🏆 Top users
    description: >
      In the index page (and also in every tag page), there is a top users card! It shows the 
      users with most XP in the whole site or in every specific tag.

    title: ⚙️ Moderation

        <li>• Questz has a complete moderation panel to watch user activity, including Questions, Answers, 
          Reports, Tags and Users.</li> 
        <li>• In the Questions/Answers panel there is also a tool to watch for restricted words and make 
          the moderation job easier.</li> 
        <li>• There is a "strike" system too. If a user has 3 strikes, he is automatically banned 
          from the website. Users receive warning and can, at any time, see how many strikes they have.</li>
      </ul>
