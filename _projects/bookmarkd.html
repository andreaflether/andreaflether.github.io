  and usually, it takes forever to find a specific tweet in the middle of it all, 
  extreme measures had to be taken. So, i present to you...
  </p>

<p class="has-text-grey-lighter">
  <b>Bookmarkd</b>! With it, you can create as many folders as you want and add the tweets of 
  your choice, by just pasting the tweet link :)
