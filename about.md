<p>
I am a senior full stack developer with 5 years of professional experience in developing software using Ruby on Rails. 
Recently, I transitioned into a Technical Lead role, where I am gaining valuable insights and skills. 
I'm dedicated to motivating my team to continually improve their code and offering support with any issues they may encounter.

I enjoy writing simple, clean code and developing solutions that make life easier for everyone. My focus is always on creating efficient, maintainable systems that not only solve problems but also enhance the overall user and developer experience.
